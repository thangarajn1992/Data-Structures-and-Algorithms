# Sorting Algorithms

Sorting Algorithms are methods of reorganizing a large number of items into some specific order such as highest to lowest, or vice-versa, or even in some alphabetical order. These algorithms taken a input list, processes it and produce the sorted list. The most common example we experience every day is sorting clothes or other items on an e-commerce website either by lowest-price to highest or list by popularity or some other order.

### Classification of Sorting Algorithms

Sorting Algorithms are classified based on 

1. Time Complexity
2. Space Complexity
3. Stability : Relative order is mantined for equal elements.
4. Internal Sort vs External Sort -&gt; If all records are in main memory/RAM it is internal, if they are in disk/tapes then they are external Sort.
5. Recursive or Non-Recursive -&gt; Quick & Merge are Recursive , while insertion and bubble are non-recursive

### Types of Sorting Algorithms

1. Bubble Sort
2. Insertion Sort
3. Selection Sort
4. Merge Sort
5. Quick Sort
6. Heap Sort
7. Shell Sort
8. Radix Sort
9. Bucket Sort

### Time Complexities of Sorting Algorithms

| Algorithm | Best | Average | Worst |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Bubble Sort | Ω\(n\) | ø\(n^2\) | O\(n^2\) |
| Insertion Sort | Ω\(n\) | ø\(n^2\) | O\(n^2\) |
| Selection Sort | Ω\(n^2\) | ø\(n^2\) | O\(n^2\) |
| Merge Sort | Ω\(n log\(n\)\) | ø\(n log\(n\)\) | O\(n log\(n\)\) |
| Quick Sort | Ω\(n log\(n\)\) | ø\(n log\(n\)\) | O\(n^2\) |
| Heap Sort | Ω\(n log\(n\)\) | ø\(n log\(n\)\) | O\(n log\(n\)\) |
| Shell Sort | Ω\(\) | ø\(\) | O\(\) |
| Radix Sort | Ω\(nk\) | ø\(nk\) | O\(nk\) |
| Bucket Sort | Ω\(n+k\) | ø\(n+k\) | O\(n^2\) |
