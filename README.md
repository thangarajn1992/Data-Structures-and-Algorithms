# Data Structures and Algorithms

In Programming, one of the key concepts in which everyone needs to be an expert is data structures and Algorithms. Though there exist multiple resources all over the internet, I felt there is no harm in consolidating those resources in concise and useful manner. 

The basic idea is to develop my knowledge and document them in a structured way to be used by anyone willing to strengthen their skill on these data structures and algorithms.
