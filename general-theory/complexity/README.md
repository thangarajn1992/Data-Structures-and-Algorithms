# Complexity

Complexity of a program denotes how complex is the code that has been written. In general we care about two complexity

1. Time Complexity  -- How much time your program takes for a given input of 'n' size.
2. Space Complexity -- How much space\(memory\) your program takes \(excluding the memory for the input\) for a given input of 'n' size,
