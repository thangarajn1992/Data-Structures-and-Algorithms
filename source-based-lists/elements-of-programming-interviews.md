## 1D Arrays

* [Rearrange array elements](../problem-solutions/1d-array-problems/rearrange-array-elements.md)
* [Smallest Non Construct-able Value](../problem-solutions/mathematics-problems/smallest-non-construct-able-value.md)
* [**6.1 The Dutch National Flag Problem**](../problem-solutions/1d-array-problems/rearrange-array-into-3-parts-based-on-given-pivot-less-than-greater-than-pivot-dutch-flag-partitioni.md): Write a Program that takes an array A and an index i into A, and rearranges the elements such that all elements less than A\[i] ( the "pivot") appear first, followed by elements equal to the pivot, followed by elements greater than the pivot
* **6.1a Partition Objects into  three groups based on their key:** Assuming that keys take one of three values, reorder the array so that all objects with the same key appear together. The order of the subarrays is not important. Use O(1) additional space and O(n) time.
* **6.1b Partition Objects into four groups based on their key:** Given an array A of n objects with keys that takes one of four values, reorder the array so that all objects that have the same key appear together. Use O(1) additional space and O(n) time.
* **6.1c Partition Boolean-Valued keys:** Given an array A of n objects with Boolean-valued keys, reorder the arrays so that objects that have key false appear first. Use O(1) additional space and O(n) time.
* **6.1d Partition Boolean-Valued Keys, Maintain Relative Order:** Given an array A of n objects with Boolean-valued keys, reorder the arrays so that objects that have key false appear first. The relative ordering of objects with key true should not change. Use O(1) additional space and O(n) time.



## nD Arrays

## Strings

* ****[**17.2 Compute Levenshtein Distance** ](../problem-solutions/string-problems/minimum-edits-to-transform-one-string-to-another-levenshtein-distance.md)**:** Write a Program that takes two strings and computes the minimum number of edits needed to transform the first string into the second string

## Linked Lists

* &#x20;[**8.1 Merge Two Sorted Singly Linked Lists**](../problem-solutions/linked-list-problems/merge-2-sorted-linked-list.md) : Write a Program that takes two lists, assumed to be sorted, and returns their merge. The only field your program can change in a node is its next field
* **8.1a Merge Two Sorted doubly Linked Lists**:  Write a Program that takes two lists, assumed to be sorted, and returns their merge. The only field your program can change in a node is its next field
* [**8.2 Reverse a Single Sub-list**](../problem-solutions/linked-list-problems/reverse-a-linked-list-between-given-start-and-end-nodes.md): Write a Program which takes a `singly Linked List L` and two integers `start` and `finish` as arguments, and reverse the order of the nodes from the start node to finish node inclusive. The numbering begins at 1, i.e head node is the first node. Do not allocate additional nodes.
* ****[**8.2a Reverse a Singly Linked List**](../problem-solutions/linked-list-problems/reverse-a-linked-list.md): Write a Program that reverses a singly linked list. The function should use no more than constant storage beyond that needed for the list itself.&#x20;
* **8.2b Reverse the list k nodes at a time**: Write a Program which takes as input a `singly linked list L` and `a nonnegative integer k`, and reverses the list `k`nodes at a time. If the number of nodes `n` in the list is not a multiple of `k`, leave the last `n mod k` nodes unchanged. Do not change the data stored within a node.
