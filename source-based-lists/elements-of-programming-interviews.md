## nD Arrays

## Strings

## Linked Lists

*  [**8.1 Merge Two Sorted Singly Linked Lists**](../problem-solutions/linked-list-problems/merge-2-sorted-linked-list.md) : Write a Program that takes two lists, assumed to be sorted, and returns their merge. The only field your program can change in a node is its next field
* **8.1a Merge Two Sorted doubly Linked Lists**:  Write a Program that takes two lists, assumed to be sorted, and returns their merge. The only field your program can change in a node is its next field
* [**8.2 Reverse a Single Sub-list**](../problem-solutions/linked-list-problems/reverse-a-linked-list-between-given-start-and-end-nodes.md): Write a Program which takes a `singly Linked List L` and two integers `start` and `finish`  as arguments, and reverse the order of the nodes from the start node to finish node inclusive. The numbering begins at 1, i.e head node is the first node. Do not allocate additional nodes.
* \*\*\*\*[**8.2a Reverse a Singly Linked List**](../problem-solutions/linked-list-problems/reverse-a-linked-list.md): Write a Program that reverses a singly linked list. The function should use no more than constant storage beyond that needed for the list itself. 
* **8.2b Reverse the list k nodes at a time**: Write a Program which takes as input a `singly linked list L` and `a nonnegative integer k`, and reverses the list `k`nodes at a time. If the number of nodes `n` in the list is not a multiple of `k`, leave the last `n mod k` nodes unchanged. Do not change the data stored within a node.
