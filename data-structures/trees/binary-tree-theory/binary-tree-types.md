# Binary Tree Types

### Unlabelled Binary Tree

If nodes in the binary tree are not labelled, then it is unlabelled Binary Tree

```
    o                 o
  /   \             /   \ 
 o     o           o     o 
```

### Labelled Binary Tree

A Binary Tree is labeled if every node is assigned a label.

```
    A                C
  /   \             /  \ 
 B     C           A    B 
```
