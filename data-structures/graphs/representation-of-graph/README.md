# Representation of Graph

A [Graph](../) is a data structure that consists of the following two components:

1. A finite set of vertices also called as nodes
2. A finite set of ordered pair of the form (u, v) called as edge. The pair is ordered because (u,v) is not the same as (v,u) in case of directed graph(di-graph). (u,v) indicates that there is an edge from vertex u to vertex v. The edges may contain weight/value/cost.

Two commonly used representations of a graph are [**Adjacency Matrix**](adjacency-matrix-representation.md)** and **[**Adjacency List**](adjacency-list-representation.md). There are other representations like Incidence matrix and Incidence list. The choice is situation-specific and depends on the type of operations to be performed and ease of use.
