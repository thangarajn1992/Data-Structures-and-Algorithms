# Graphs

A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges.The nodes are also referred as vertices and edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph. **A Graph consists of a finite set of vertices \(or nodes\) and set of Edges which connect a pair of nodes.**

Graphs are used to solve many real-life problems. Graphs are used to represent networks. The networks may include paths in a city or telephone network or circuit network. Graphs are also used in social networks like linkedin, facebook etc. Eg., In Facebook, each person is represented with a vertex. Each node is a structure and contains information like person-id, name, gender, location etc.
