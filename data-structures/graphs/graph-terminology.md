## Strongly Connected Components

A directed graph is strongly connected if there is a **path between all pairs of vertices**. A strongly connected component \(SCC\) of a directed graph is a maximal strongly connected sub-graph. For eg., there are 3 SCCs in the following graph.

We can find all strongly connected components in \(V+E\) time using [kosaraju's algorithm](../../algorithms/kosarajus-algorithm.md).
