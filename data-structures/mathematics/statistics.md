## Permutation Combination

1. In how many ways, N items can be arranged ? N! (N Factorial)
2. The number of ways (permutations) that you can select k items from n total items (all unique) when order matters is: $$nPk = n!/(n-k)!$$
3. The number of combinations (when order does not matter) of K items selected from n different items without replacement is: $$nCk = n!/(n-k)! * k!$$
