# Mathematics



### Properties of Prime:

* The prime factors of the given number `n` will be in the range  `[2, sqrt(n)]`

### Fermat Theorem

Any positive number`n`is expressible as a sum of two squares if and only if the prime factorization of `n`, every prime of the form`(4k+3)` occurs an even number of times.

### Geometry

* **For a triangle to be possible from 3 values, the sum of any of the two values (or sides) must be greater than the third value (or third side).**
